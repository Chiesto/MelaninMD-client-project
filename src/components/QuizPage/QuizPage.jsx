                  Recommendation is to include gentle, soothing, and hydrating
                  ingredients that help maintain the skins protective moisture
                  barrierâ€”such as ceramides for example, SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid
                  Restore, or CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. It is recommended to avoid
                  excessively long, hot showers, moisturizing multiple times per
                  day, and opting for skincare products that are fragrance-free,
                  non-comedogenic, and alcohol-free.
