                  Recommendation is to include gentle, soothing, and hydrating
                  ingredients that help maintain the skins protective moisture
                  barrierâ€”such as ceramides for example, SkinCeuticals Triple
                  Lipid Restore, or CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. It is recommended
                  to avoid excessively long, hot showers, moisturizing multiple
                  times per day, and opting for skincare products that are
                  fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and alcohol-free.

            Knowing your skin type is essential for effective skincare and
            overall skin health. Each skin type has unique characteristics and
            needs, and using products and routines tailored to your specific
            type can help address concerns and maintain a healthy complexion.
            For example, oily skin may require oil-controlling products to
            prevent breakouts, while dry skin needs hydrating products to retain
            moisture. Using the wrong products for your skin type can lead to
            issues like irritation, acne, or excessive dryness. Understanding
            your skin type empowers you to make informed choices in your
            skincare routine, ensuring that you provide the right care and
            support for your skin's specific requirements.
